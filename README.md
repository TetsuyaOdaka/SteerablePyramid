# Steerable Pyramid
Python3 Implementation of steerable pyramid.

This is based on the article bellow.

[The Heeger-Bergen Pyramid-Based Texture Synthesis Algorithm, Briand,T. et al. (2014)](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/79/)

According to this article, this is a "real version" of steerable pyramid which is used in Portilla and Simoncelli(2000).

[Parametric Texture Model Based on Joint Statistics of Complex Wavelet Coefficient, Portilla, J. and Simoncelli, E.(2000) ](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/pub/lcv/portilla99.pdf)

 ## Results
 - Depth : 4
 - Orientation : 4 (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4)
